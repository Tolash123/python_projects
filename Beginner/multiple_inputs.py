Problem Statement for Taking Multiple User Inputs with Python
Suppose you are prompted to write a Python program that interacts with a user in a console window. You may be accepting input to send to a database, or reading numbers to use in a calculation.

Whatever the purpose, you should code a loop that reads one or multiple user inputs from a user typing on a keyboard and prints a result for each. In other words, you have to write a classic print loop program.
